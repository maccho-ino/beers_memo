# BEER'S MEMO

### It is an application to keep track of the beers you have drunk!

This is the first original application I created during school.

You can post your own beers to keep notes on what you drank, or browse other users' posts.

Beers are categorized by country and style, so you can find the beer you want to drink depending on your mood.
